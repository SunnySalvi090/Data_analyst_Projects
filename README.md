# eCommerce_InsightX
üì¶ Ecommerce Data Analysis Project
This project is a SQL-based data analysis of an eCommerce dataset. It demonstrates key data analytics skills using complex SQL queries to extract valuable business insights such as top-paying customers, revenue patterns, and customer behavior over time.

üìä Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate the role of a Data Analyst working with raw eCommerce data. It showcases:

Data cleaning and joining across multiple tables (e.g., orders, payments)

Aggregation and ranking of customer payments

Year-wise analysis of top spenders

Use of analytical SQL functions like DENSE_RANK(), GROUP BY, and JOIN

üîç Key SQL Logic Example
sql
Copy

SELECT years, customer_id, payment, d_rank 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        YEAR(orders.order_purchase_timestamp) AS years,
        orders.customer_id,
        SUM(payments.payment_value) AS payment,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY YEAR(orders.order_purchase_timestamp) 
            ORDER BY SUM(payments.payment_value) DESC
        ) AS d_rank
    FROM orders 
    JOIN payments ON payments.order_id = orders.order_id
    GROUP BY orders.order_purchase_timestamp, orders.customer_id
) AS a
WHERE d_rank <= 3;
üß† This query returns the top 3 spending customers per year, highlighting repeat high-value buyers.
